### Experience at ThoughtWorks {#experience}
__Apr 2013 - now__

* Client: One of the biggest Finicial companies in Australia
: *Brisbane, Australia / Chengdu, China*
  __Apr 2013 - now__

  This engagement was to help the client to accomplish the technical architecture transformation. The client owned more than 20 brands include both Insurance and Banking. The client maintained two Customer Master Data Management (MDM) systems and a couple front-end applications used by the call center, which needs to aggregate all the customer information from different source systems and integrate with them to provide real-time services. Most of the assets were legacy monolithic systems and integrated with ESB.
  
  A 9-ThoughtWorkers team (5 pods) is now working with the client team, building microservices to replace ESB, building new Customer MDM and maintaining the legacy MDMs. As the tech lead, Yaodan got involved with the following key assets and projects.

  ###### *1. <u>Customer MDM</u>:*
  
  IBM Infosphere MDM product is purchased to replace the two legacy Customer MDMs owned by our client. The team is implementing it and building RESTful APIs acting upon it to provide real-time services.

  ***Challenge:*** As it is a monolithic application, the installation/configuration/deployment of IBM MDM is hard to be done and a lot of manual effort is required.

  ***Accomplished:*** Yaodan led the infrastructure stream and automated the whole process of product installation/upgrade, application server configuration, customization extension deployment.

  ###### *2. <u>RESTful APIs</u>:*
  
  A couple of Sring Boot based RESTful APIs are built and owned by the team, providing services of Customer, Marketing Consent, Customer Data Scrubbing, etc..

  ***Challenge:*** The existing integration was built based on Enterprise Message Bus, and more than 20 brands and 10 upstream or downstream systems need to be itegrated. It was a monolithic application owned by a delegated team and became a single point of failure.

  ***Accomplished:*** Yaodan led the architecture migration from ESB to microservices, and development of the various RESTful APIs.

  ###### *3. <u>Legacy Transactional Customer MDM</u>:*

  GCIS is a transactional customer repository that provides real-time customer services.

  ***Challenge:*** The transactional customer MDM was a 15 years old legacy system which was built on legacy tech stacks such as COBOL and EJB. There were no automation tests and new features were hard to be introduced.

  ***Accomplished:*** As the tech lead, Yaodan led the improvement and simplification of this system. Include: improving functional tests, introducing Groovy and Spock as unit test framework to increase test coverage, and simplifying codebase on a daily basis.

  ###### *4. <u>Legacy Analytical Customer MDM</u>*

  ***Challenge:*** The analytical customer MDM is a batch application based on IBM Initiate, which aggregates the customer & product data from all the source systems within the Corporate. It needs to transform the data model from all the different source systems into a single one. The performance is not good enough and there are a lot of production incidents.

  ***Accomplished:*** As the tech lead, Yaodan led the performance improvement and reducing production incidents.
